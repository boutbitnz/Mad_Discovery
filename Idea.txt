Ideas are coming soon!

I heard an interesting podcast with respect to the impact of technology on government that might provide some inspiration for Build Madison.  I follow Standford's Entreprenurial Thought Leaders podcast online 

		(http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html or via iTunes) 

and listened to one recently that I thought was interesting:

Given the title "Make Government Work Better for All", I was surprisingly inspired after listening.

The City of Madison has an open data site: 

		https://data.cityofmadison.com/

that is unfortunately somewhat underwhelming.  There is a federal government data site as well: 
		https://www.data.gov/ 

with many of those being available via RESTful service calls.
These are of course just one possible area of investigation.

_This is a good idea. I think Scott is referring for us to redo the sites.. We could do this easily._

Another idea is to build something with the Arduino we had experimented with at Secter67.
here is the web site with an image of the board we would be working with and a lot of info. Good idea also to download the software for experimenting. You will need to in order to operate the code.

I was thinking maybe building something on top of it and making it do something. There are tons of legos that we could possibly use or other material.

Something like that and program it to operate. There are plenty of other things we cold build out of the legos or whatever is there.
